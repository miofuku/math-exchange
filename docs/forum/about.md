# About MathExchange

This site's focus is **mathematics**. We welcome posts that are:

* detailed and specific, written clearly and simply

No question is too trivial or too "newbie".

But we recommend that you make use of the search services to see if your question has already been asked (perhaps even answered!) before you ask. But if you end up asking a question that has been asked before, that is fine too. Other users will hopefully edit in links to related or similar questions to help future visitors find their way.
